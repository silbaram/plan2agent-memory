# Gate B Specification Contract

Read before authoring or validating `spec_json`.

## Canonical output

Return `spec_json` conforming to `spec.schema.json`, `open_decisions`, and one `clarifying_question_disposition` for every intake `CQ-n`. Preserve intake evidence and add only inspected `WEB-n` or `LOCAL-n` sources. JSON is canonical; Markdown is a generated view.

When intake comes from persisted `intake.json`, set `source_intake` to its Gate A path and compute `source_intake_sha256` from its exact bytes. Recompute only when regenerating from a changed intake.

## Product fields

`spec_json.product` includes:

- `problem`
- `target_users`
- `goals`
- `must_preserve`
- `non_goals`
- `core_flows`
- `screens_or_interfaces`
- `data_model_draft`
- `external_integrations`
- `success_criteria`
- `constraints`

`spec_json.evidence` follows the harness evidence contract.

## Visual experience

New specs include `visual_experience` with `has_visual_interface`, `design_scope`, `design_timing`, and a concrete `rationale`.

- `full + current_iteration` requires `experience_spec_ref`, its exact SHA-256, and an explicitly approved visual experience.
- `reuse + current_iteration` requires `design_system_refs`.
- Function-first work may choose `minimal` or `full + deferred_iteration` when justified.

For `full + current_iteration`, invoke `p2a-visual-experience` and keep Gate B draft until its HTML prototype and experience contract are approved.

## Implementation fields

`spec_json.implementation` includes:

- `architecture`
- `interfaces`
- `data_flow`
- `dependencies`
- `edge_cases`
- `verification`

The implementation plan conforms to the approved constitution. Architecture and stack are durable constraints; style guides implementation. Validator prohibitions are hard failures, while review and advisory prohibitions remain judgment guidance. A required constitution change returns to focused Gate ② amendment rather than silently overriding it.

## Clarifying-question disposition

Each intake question id appears exactly once with `id`, `status`, `rationale`, `affects`, and only the detail required by its status:

- `answered` → `resolved_by`
- `assumed` → `assumption`
- `deferred_non_goal` → `non_goal`
- `promoted_to_decision` → `promoted_decision_id`

Only `ND-n` ids belong in `open_decisions`. Promote an unresolved blocking `CQ-n` to `ND-n` and keep the spec draft. Map canonical answered, assumed, or not-applicable intake values directly instead of replacing them with generic assumptions.

Route every answered high-impact decision to the exact `product.*` or `implementation.*` fields it affects. Treat a legacy `interview` object as opaque compatibility data. Never inspect it for routing.

## Approval

- Gate A must be `ready_for_spec` with a valid approval audit.
- A new project requires an approved constitution; only legacy projects retain the no-constitution fallback.
- Keep `approval: draft` until every `CQ-n` is disposed, all promoted decisions are resolved, `open_decisions` is empty, and required visual approval exists.
- The authoring pass never fabricates approval fields. After explicit approval, the harness owner records the exact quote through `node .plan2agent/scripts/p2a.mjs decide`.
- Do not advance to task breakdown while the spec is draft.
