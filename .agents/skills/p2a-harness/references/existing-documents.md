## Starting From Existing Documents

Rich input documents make gates faster, not skippable. Classify document input before
the first gate:

When the entry has a sibling `p2a-reference-bundle.json`, validate the entry first and
treat the bundle as a conditional index. Read its ids, kinds, hashes, descriptions, and
`load_when` values without opening every target. Inspect a referenced file only when its
condition is material to the current Gate A/B decision, recheck the declared hash, and
record an inspected file as `LOCAL-n` evidence with the `REF-n` id and hash in
`used_for`. Unselected references remain indexed context, not evidence or approval.
Before requesting Gate A approval, run
`p2a reference snapshot --target <project-dir> --entry <path> --artifacts <artifact-root>`.
The command copies the validated entry, bundle, and declared reference bytes under
`gate-a-intake/reference-sources/` and derives `reference-bundle-snapshot.json`; never
hand-author or copy its hashes from model output. `node .plan2agent/scripts/p2a.mjs decide` includes that sidecar
and its exact SHA-256 in the approval audit when called with the same `--entry <path>`;
approval fails if the entry or bundle bytes no longer match. Gate B owns the matching
`gate-b-spec/reference-bundle-usage.json`; the artifact validator rejects missing,
stale, unapproved, or incorrectly evidenced provenance for an approved spec.

1. **General design or plan documents** (for example `DESIGN.md`, `PLAN.md`, or files
   under `docs/`) are `LOCAL-n` input evidence. Run the full pipeline from Gate A: use
   the documents to populate `known_facts`, reduce open questions, and cite them in
   rationale. Present the Gate A analysis and stop for approval even when no decision
   remains open.
2. **Prior Plan2Agent artifacts available only as Markdown** must be reconstructed into
   their JSON contracts first. Approval state still governs: a reconstructed spec
   without a recorded user `approval_audit` is `draft` and stops at Gate B.
3. **Canonical artifacts under `.plan2agent/artifacts/<project_id>/` with recorded
   approvals** are the only input that justifies resuming past a gate, and only up to
   the last recorded approval.
