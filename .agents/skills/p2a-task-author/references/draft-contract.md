# Gate C Draft Contract

Read before authoring a new task graph draft.

Run:

```bash
node .plan2agent/scripts/p2a.mjs iteration context --artifacts <root>
```

Use the `p2a.task_context.v1` fields: `project_id`, `effective_spec`, `existing_tasks`, `spec_field_changes`, `planning_memory`, `idea`, `active_iteration`, and `code_signals`. Real code signals prevent duplicate or already-completed work.

The author returns complete JSON without writing. The owner may persist only:

```text
iterations/<active_iteration>/gate-c-task-graph/task-graph.draft.json
```

The draft conforms to `p2a.task_graph.v1` and contains the exact project id, `<active_iteration>-draft` version, `../gate-b-spec/spec.json` source, and `tasks[]`.

Each task includes sequential `task-NNN` id, title, description, `todo` status, same-graph dependencies, concrete acceptance criteria, target area, a short outcome-focused agent prompt, and at least one real `sourceSpecRefs` field. Do not restate the full implementation recipe in the agent prompt.

For `full + current_iteration`, every task declares `workKind`. UI/mixed tasks include only lightweight `visualImpact.screenStates`; non-UI tasks omit it. Impact routes remediation and does not own final review cases.

## Decomposition judgment

- Prefer one cohesive vertical item when one owner can implement and verify it in one resumable run.
- Split only for a real dependency, separate write owner, useful verification/rollback boundary, or cross-session recovery value.
- Split by independently verifiable outcomes, not automatically by file, screen, API, data, and test layers.
- Merge tightly coupled work even across target areas.
- Each task's acceptance must be satisfiable from its explicit scope.
- Keep graphs acyclic and dependencies inside the same draft.
- Do not create tasks absent from the approved effective spec.
- When `spec_field_changes` exists, focus on changed fields without losing necessary baseline context.

Use Planning Memory only when materially relevant. Add `memory:<ref>` and applicable `decision:ND-n` in addition to a real spec field. Convert relevant failure evidence into mitigation or regression acceptance. Unavailable or irrelevant Memory is not a blocker.

Product meaning changes return to a new feature iteration through Gates A-C; they are not smuggled into a task draft.
