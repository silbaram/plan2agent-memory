# Plan2Agent Dev Execution

Own one approved Gate B execution objective through implementation and recorded closeout. The Gate-derived execution envelope is the contract; task prose is routing metadata. This skill may prepare the synthetic Direct/Planned compatibility work item, but it does not author product decisions or broaden scope.

## Preconditions

Start only when Gate B is approved and `open_decisions` is empty. For an existing Gate C graph, selected work must come from one valid `node .plan2agent/scripts/p2a.mjs tasks ready` snapshot and each work item must have acceptance criteria. With `--prepare-mode adaptive|direct|planned`, Gate C may be absent until preparation creates it.

The user's request to develop an approved iteration authorizes its ready implementation work. It does not authorize external writes, credentials, costs, deployment, irreversible actions, or a change to product meaning.

Use a single owner unless several independent ready items have separate owners and bounded parallelism materially helps. Mode selection is an implementation judgment, not a new product approval.

## Progressive reference routing

The canonical load conditions are recorded in `.agents/context-routes.json`. Read references only at their entry condition:

1. Required, on-demand; stages: gate-c, execution — `references/execution-lifecycle.md` — Gate C is absent and execution needs preparation, or a single-owner run is about to start or resume.
2. Required, on-demand; stages: execution — `references/provider-confinement.md` — A write-capable owner is about to start or resume implementation.
3. Required, on-demand; stages: execution, closeout — `references/verification-closeout.md` — The implementation outcome is ready for executable verification, checkpointing, or run closeout.
4. Required, conditional; stages: acceptance, closeout — `references/acceptance-review.md` — Acceptance review policy is on, explicitly opted in, or an acceptance run is already active, and no required visual contract replaces it.
5. Required, conditional; stages: execution; modes: orchestrated — `references/batch-execution.md` — Two or more independent ready tasks will run concurrently in isolated worktrees.
6. Required, conditional; stages: monitor, closeout — `references/monitor-gate.md` — The current run was started with --require-monitor.
7. Required, conditional; stages: visual, closeout — `references/visual-evidence.md` — The task is UI or mixed, or the approved execution envelope contains a visual contract.

## Direct/Planned runtime packet entry

For a structured Direct/Planned continuation, use `node .plan2agent/scripts/p2a.mjs context show` once and consume the returned reference bodies instead of reopening packet-managed paths individually:

- `execution.prepare`: bind the current immediate action with `--continuation execution.prepare`.
- `execution.owner-start`, `execution.visual-review`, or `execution.acceptance-review`: first require a successful `p2a.execution_result.v1` with `runStatus=started`, then pass its `runId` with the returned continuation id.
- Retry, verification/closeout, visual, acceptance, and monitor judgment during a started run may request an explicit `--phase <phase> --run-id <id>` packet. The owner still decides when implementation is ready for a read-only phase.

The packet supplies canonical references; it does not grant approval, write, finish, deployment, credential, or external-cost authority. Orchestrated and batch execution continue to use the declared reference routing above until separately evaluated.

## Core procedure

1. Inspect the approved envelope and repository evidence. For adaptive preparation, use the preparation context and select Direct, Planned, or Orchestrated without requesting a new product approval.
2. Confirm the ready work item, inspect retry evidence when applicable, and preserve one run identity through start or resume.
3. Apply the resolved provider confinement plus the approved constitution or legacy style fallback.
4. Implement the envelope objective inside the assigned workspace. Correct ordinary implementation, test, and UI drift autonomously.
5. Execute configured or explicit verification. Planned runs also verify every checkpoint in order.
6. Apply only the conditional visual, acceptance, or monitor path selected by policy and the approved contract.
7. Finish through `node .plan2agent/scripts/p2a.mjs execute finish`, preserving changed-file attribution and structured failure evidence.
8. Run a retrospective only after failure, retry, explicit correction, or a repeated process defect; proposal writes require separate approval.

Return to Gate B instead of implementing only when satisfying the objective requires changing product meaning, acceptance, approved scope, constitution, or an external authority boundary.

## Lifecycle ownership

The foreground owner controls run start, verification, checkpoint, finish, task transition, integration, and lifecycle evidence. A spawned implementer performs scoped edits and local self-checks only. Review agents are independent and read-only unless their approved protocol explicitly writes a lifecycle sidecar through the foreground owner.

Generated or historical style/milestone review artifacts remain readable, but new runs do not create standalone style or milestone passes. Style belongs to the constitution and optional monitor contract.

## Supervised Batch Owner Procedure

Read this section only when running two or more independent ready tasks. Freeze one ready snapshot, then read `references/batch-execution.md` and follow it. If independent confinement, serial integration ownership, or a clean canonical integration branch is unavailable, fall back to the single-task procedure.

## Completion contract

Do not claim completion until real commands verify the required outcome and the lifecycle command records the result. Report implemented changes, exact changed files, command outcomes, and the recommended task state. Preserve failed evidence rather than rewriting it into a success.
